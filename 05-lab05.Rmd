## Pre-class activity

## Wrangling Data
It would be nice to always get data formatted in the way that you want it, but alas, one of the challenges as a scientist is dealing with Other People’s Data. People often structure data in ways that is convenient for data entry, but not very convenient for data analysis, and so much effort must be expended ’wrangling’ data into shape before you can do more interesting things with it. Also, performing analyses often requires pulling together data obtained from different sources: you have done this in semester 1 by combining the participant information with the depression and happiness data. In this lesson, we are going to give you some tips on how to structure data, and introduce strategies for transforming and combining data from different sources.

## The Autism Quotient (AQ)
To illustrate these concepts, we will use some actual survey data that was collected online using SurveyMonkey.com (Note: the data have been slightly cleaned up to make things a bit simpler; in reality, the data files were even messier than it appears!)
For this research project, prospective participants completed the short 10-item version of the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) (Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Skinner, Martin, & Clubley, 2001), which is designed to measure autistic traits in adults. The data from Survey Monkey was downloaded as a .csv file, a common text format that you should be familiar with by now.

Table 1: The ten items on the AQ-10.

```{r} 

table_1 <- tibble(
  Q_No = paste("Q", 1:10),
  Question = c(
  "I often notice small sounds when others do not.",
  "I usually concentrate more on the whole picture, rather than small details.",
  "I find it easy to do more than one thing at once.",
  "If there is an interruption, I can switch back to what I was doing very quickly.", 
  "I find it easy to read between the lines when someone is talking to me.",
  "I know how to tell if someone listening to me is getting bored.",
  "When I’m reading a story, I find it difficult to work out the characters’ intentions.",
  "I like to collect information about categories of things.", 
  "I find it easy to work out what someone is thinking or feeling just by looking at their face.", 
  "I find it difficult to work out people’s intentions.")) 

knitr::kable(table_1)

```

Responses to each item were measured on a four-point scale: Definitely Disagree, Slightly Disagree, Slightly Agree, Definitely Agree.

To avoid response bias, each question is scored according to **one** of **two different question formats**. In questions 1, 7, 8, and 10 a point is assigned for agreement (either “Slightly Agree” or “Definitely Agree”) and zero otherwise. We will call this format **“F”** (for forward). The remaining questions (e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9) are **reverse coded (format “R”)**: a point is assigned for disagreement (“Slightly Disagree” or “Definitely Disagree”) and zero otherwise.

The AQ for each participant is just the total points across all 10 questions. The higher the AQ score, the more ’autistic traits’ they are assumed to exhibit. Our goal is to calculate an AQ score for each participant in the dataset. Download the data here:

[AQ Data](http://talklab.psy.gla.ac.uk/L1_labs/lab_4/prep/responses.csv)

The data should look like this:
![Data](images/widedata.png) 
<br>
To preserve anonymity, each participant was given a unique number, coded by the variable Id, shown in the first column of the table. The rest of the columns contain the responses associated with that participant for each of the 10 question (Q1, Q2, Q3, …, Q10).
<br>
This data format is known as **wide** format: each unit of analysis (participant) forms a single row in the table, and each observation on that unit forms a separate column. Wide format is often convenient for data entry, but for reasons that will soon become apparent, we will find this format inconvenient for the task of scoring the responses.

<br>

## Thinking through the problem

We technically _could_ clean up our data by hand. However, we have 66 participants in this dataset with each participant providing 10 responses. This means we would have to manually tidy up 660 responses. Not only is this a horribly mind-numbing task, it is also one in which you will be prone to make errors, especially as you get bored and your mind begins to wander. Even if you are 99% accurate, that means you will still get about 7 of the scores wrong. Worst of all, this approach does not scale beyond small datasets. As this survey was done over the internet, it could have easily been the case that you ended up with 6,600 participants instead of just 66.

******

**Pause here and think about how you might calculate AQ scores for each participant**

* Imagine carrying out this task by hand. What are the necessary steps? 


******

Let’s imagine we are doing the task by hand so that we understand the logic. Once that logic is clear, we’ll go through it again and show you how to write the script to make it happen.

Let’s take stock of what we know. First, we know that there are two question formats, and that questions Q1, Q7, Q8, and Q10 are scored according to format F and questions Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6, and Q9 are scored according to format R. We can represent this information in the table below:

```{r}

table_2 <- tibble(Question = paste("Q",1:10), 
                  QFormat = c("F", "R","R","R","R", "R", "F","F","R","F"))

knitr::kable(table_2)

```

We also know that for format **F**, we award a point for **agree**, zero for **disagree**. For format **R**, a point for **disagree**, zero for **agree**. We can represent that information as:

```{r} 

table_3 <- tibble(QFormat = sort(c("F", "R","R","R","R", "F","F","F")),
                  Response = c("Definitely Agree", "Slightly Agree", "Slightly Disagree", "Definitely Disagree", 
                               "Definitely Agree", "Slightly Agree", "Slightly Disagree", "Definitely Disagree"), 
                  Score = c(1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1))


knitr::kable(table_3)
```

Now that we have put that information into tables, it just becomes a simple matter of looking up the format based on the question number (Q1, Q2, …, Q10); given the format and the response, we can then assign the score.

Let’s walk through the example with the first participant. For this participant (Id = 16), we have the following responses:
  
```{r} 


table_4 <- tibble(
  Question = paste("Q", 1:10),
  Response = c(
  "Slightly Disagree",
  "Definitely Agree",
  "Slightly Disagree",
  "Definitely Disagree",
  "Slightly Agree",
  "Slightly Agree",
  "Slightly Agree",
  "Definitely Disagree",
  "Slightly Agree",
  "Slightly Agree"))

knitr::kable(table_4)


```

Note that we have re-formatted the responses so that each response is in a separate row, rather than having all of the responses in a single row, as above. **We have reshaped the data from its original wide format to long format**. This format is called **long** because instead of having just one row for each participant, we will now have 10 rows for a total of 66 x 10 = 660. While this format makes it less easy to take the whole dataset in with a single glance, it actually ends up being much easier to deal with, because ’Question’ is a now a single variable whose levels are Q1, Q2, …, Q10, and ’Response’ is also now a single variable. Most functions that you will be working with in R will expect your data to be in long rather than wide format.

Let’s now look up the format for each question:

```{r} 


table_5 <- tibble(
  Question = paste("Q", 1:10),
  Response = c(
  "Slightly Disagree",
  "Definitely Agree",
  "Slightly Disagree",
  "Definitely Disagree",
  "Slightly Agree",
  "Slightly Agree",
  "Slightly Agree",
  "Definitely Disagree",
  "Slightly Agree",
  "Slightly Agree"), 
  QFormat = c("F","R","R","R","R","R","F","F","R","F"))

knitr::kable(table_5)


```

And now that we have the format and the response, we can look up the scores:

```{r} 

table_6 <- tibble( Question = paste("Q", 1:10),
  Response = c(
  "Slightly Disagree",
  "Definitely Agree",
  "Slightly Disagree",
  "Definitely Disagree",
  "Slightly Agree",
  "Slightly Agree",
  "Slightly Agree",
  "Definitely Disagree",
  "Slightly Agree",
  "Slightly Agree"), 
  QFormat = c("F","R","R","R","R","R","F","F","R","F"),
  Score = c(0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1))

```

Then we just add up the scores, which yields an AQ score of 4 for participant 16. We would then repeat this logic for the remaining 65 participants. Anyone fancy doing this for a big data set?!

Due to the large margin for error in carrying out this task by hand, it's important to learn how to make the computer do the dirty work. The computer won't make mistakes and will free up your mind to focus on the bigger issues in your research.

* Have a think about the `tidyverse` verb functions you were introduced to in Semester One. Can you think of any that may be helpful in cleaning this data? Try and translate the steps we carried out above into code.

**The investment you are currently making in building your data science skills will pay off in the long run as these skills are used by researchers every single day**. 

In lab 1 of this semester, we will work on using R to get our data into shape. In lab 2, we will introduce pipes which are a more efficient way of joining functions together! 

See you all in the labs!

## In Class Activity

Let’s continue what we started in the prep by hand but now using R to change the data from wide to long format.

First, we will need to create a new working directory and download the data files.

* responses.csv : survey responses
* qformats.csv : table linking questions to question formats
* scoring.csv : table linking formats and responses to score
* pinfo.csv : participant information (Sex, Age, etc.)

Make a new R script, make sure to set your working directory where those files can be located, and load in tidyverse at the top of your R script. Next, load in the three first files.

```{r, T1, message = FALSE}
responses <- read_csv("files/responses.csv") # survey responses
qformats <- read_csv("files/qformats.csv") # question formats
scoring <- read_csv("files/scoring.csv") # scoring info
```

Whenever you load in data, it is always a good idea to have a quick look to make sure things make sense. You can do this by typing `glimpse(name of data frame)` or `View(name of data frame)` down in your console. You can also simply type the name of your data frame into the console to have a look at how your data is organised. 

## `gather()`

The first step is to transform our data from wide to long using R. To do this, we will use the function `gather()`. `gather()` takes multiple columns and collapses them so that each unique variable has it’s own column. More information on `gather()` can be found [here](https://shannon-mcnee.github.io/UG-level1-prac/Intro_Tidyverse.html#gather()). 

```{r, T2}
rlong <- gather(responses, Question, Response, Q1:Q10)
```

Let’s translate this line of code into English. Here, you are telling R: take the `responses` data frame (input argument 1), create a key column called “Question” (input argument 2), and a value column called “Response” (input argument 3), by **gathering** columns Q1 through to Q10 (input argument 4).

All this means is that R is taking columns Q1 to Q10, and instead of each Question having its own column (e.g. Q1, Q2, Q3…), the Questions are now gathered into one column: **Question**. This is our **key** column. Similarly, the Responses for each Question have now been gathered into one column: **Response**. This is our **value** column.

Type `View(rlong)` into your console. See how much better our data looks already?

We have now created a tibble with 660 observations over 3 variables; 10 observations per 66 participants on 3 variables. Let's make it simpler just now and only use **one participant**. We can do that by using `filter()` which you used last semester and creating a new tibble called rlong_16. 

## `filter()`

******

**Pause here and test your knowledge**

* What does `filter()` do? 

`r mcq(c("splits a column into multiple columns", "transforms existing columns", "takes multiple columns and collapses them together", answer = "removes information that we are not interested in"))`

******

```{r, T3}
rlong_16 <- filter(rlong, Id == 16)
```

Here, we are telling R: take the `rlong` data frame, go to the `Id` column, and pull out all rows associated with id 16. We should now have a tibble with 10 observations of 3 variables. More information about `filter()` can be found [here](https://shannon-mcnee.github.io/UG-level1-prac/Intro_Tidyverse.html#filter()). 

The next step is to match each question with a **format** (F or R). However, we have this information in the table **qformats**. How can we **combine** two tables? 

`r hide("I need a hint")`

We can use a variety of different **mutating joins** to join two tables. However, the main one we will use is [`inner_join()`](https://shannon-mcnee.github.io/UG-level1-prac/Data_Relations.html#inner_join())

`r unhide()`

## `inner_join()`

```{r, T4}
rlong2 <- inner_join(rlong_16, qformats, "Question")
```

Here, we are telling R: take the data frames `rlong_16` and `qformats` and **join** them by the column **Question**. 

* Which statement best explains what `inner_join()` has done here? 

`r mcq(c("inner_join has kept all information from rlong_16 and added on a new column called Response", answer = "inner_join has kept all information that matches in rlong_16 and qformats, adding a new column called QFormat to rlong_16", "inner_join has kept all information from rlong_16 and dropped some information from qformats"))`

What the inner join does is match up rows in the two tables where both tables have the same value for the field named in the third argument, “Question”; it then combines the columns from the two tables, copying rows where necessary. To state it more simply, what it does, in effect, is the following: For each row in rlong, it checks the value of the column Question, and looks for rows with the same value in qformats, and then essentially combines all of the other columns in the two tables for these matching rows. If there are unmatching values, the rows get dropped. The inner_join() is one of the most useful and time-saving operations in data wrangling so keep ptracticing as it will keep reappearing time after time.  

Now that we have matched up each question with its corresponding format, we can now “look up” the corresponding scores in the scoring table based on the format and the response.

**This means we have to use `inner_join()` once again to join `rlong2` with `scoring`**

```{r, T5}
rscores <- inner_join(rlong2, scoring, c("QFormat", "Response"))
```

So here we have created a new data frame called `rscores` using `inner_join()` to join `rlong2` and `scoring` using columns `QFormat` and `Response` and you are at a point where you are ready to calculate the AQ scores for participant 16. 

******

You have used a function to calculate the total last semester. Can you remember which one?

`r mcq(c(answer = "summarise", "filter", "arrange", "group_by"))`

`r hide("Explain this answer")`

Technically, there are two functions you used last semester to work out the total: `group_by` and `summarise`. You used `group_by` first to make sure data is grouped by a specific column. You then used `summarise` to compute summary statistics. 

Look back in your scripts and .Rmd files to remember where you have used these functions and how you can use it to calculate the total for participant 16. 

`r unhide()`
